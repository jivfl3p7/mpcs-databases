NOTE
----
All of the queries run for me. I went back and dropped all of my tables, fixed a few errors in my code, and re-created all the tables and so the create_db.sql and populate_db.sql should work properly now.

If it doesn't, then I think I need to talk about this in person, step by step, because all the queries are running for me!
