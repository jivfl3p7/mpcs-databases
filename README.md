PROJECT
-------
I am an avid League of Legends player. Naturally, I decided to do all my projects on League of Legends.

We began the course by creating an ERD and working from there to create our own database with multiple entities and relationships.

Throughout the course, we were tested on various MySQL concepts such as triggers, procedures, complicated queries, etc., developing our database over time. Our "dummy data" had to contain at least 1000 entries and we tested our queries and database using high volumes of data calls.

The final project was to host the database we created onto a website that we had to customize using PHP and HTML. I used Python to generate my data.
